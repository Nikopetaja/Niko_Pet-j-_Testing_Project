> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- My experience testing the GitLab web application was both insightful and challenging. I appreciated the opportunity to work with a real-world application that provided a variety of functionalities to test. The complexity of features like project creation, issue management, and user registration allowed me to enhance my testing skills and understand the intricacies involved in a robust web application.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I started by reviewing the requirements and existing test cases to understand the expected functionalities. Then, I followed a structured approach to write new test cases by identifying the key functionalities of each page, defining the preconditions, and outlining the steps to execute the tests. Using a consistent template helped in managing the test cases effectively, ensuring clarity and completeness.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I recommend using tools like TestRail or Jira for test case management, as they provide features for organizing, executing, and tracking test cases efficiently. Additionally, adopting a behavior-driven development (BDD) style using tools like Cucumber could enhance collaboration between testers and developers by using natural language for writing test scenarios.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code for editing files. Its user-friendly interface, integrated terminal, and extensive extensions made it easy to navigate and manage the project files effectively.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I encountered some issues with understanding the specific functionality of certain features in the web application. To resolve this, I consulted the GitLab documentation and sought clarification from online sources to better understand the application. This approach helped me gain a clearer understanding of the functionalities.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I didn't have any trouble using Github. I have used Github in the past for various projects and I am quite familiar with it. 
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would choose Selenium for automating these test cases due to its flexibility and wide support for various browsers and programming languages. Selenium allows for robust end-to-end testing and can easily integrate with other testing frameworks like TestNG or JUnit, which is beneficial for managing larger test suites.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- According to job postings on Glassdoor and LinkedIn, the most in-demand skills for software testers include:
    Proficiency in automation testing tools (Selenium, Cypress)
    Knowledge of programming languages (Java, Python)
    Understanding of Agile and DevOps methodologies
    Experience with test management tools (Jira, TestRail)
    Strong analytical and problem-solving skills



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- For a career in Software Testing, I would need to enhance my technical skills in automation testing tools and scripting languages. Soft skills like effective communication, attention to detail, and critical thinking are also essential for collaborating with development teams and ensuring high-quality deliverables.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- This project significantly bridged the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. By engaging in real-world testing scenarios, I learned how to apply testing methodologies and frameworks effectively. The hands-on experience in creating test cases and identifying bugs was invaluable. Overall, I found the quality of content in the study module to be excellent, and it provided ample opportunities for learning and growth.
